# SOC AI Agents Advanced Features - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Successfully Implemented Advanced Features

### 1. Idempotency & Deduplication ‚úÖ
- **Implementation**: `execution_tracker.py` with TTL-based action tracking
- **Features**:
  - Unique playbook_id and action_id generation
  - Persistent execution records with configurable TTL
  - Duplicate action detection and skipping
  - Playbook execution state tracking
  - Comprehensive statistics and audit trail
- **Acceptance**: ‚úÖ Replaying same playbook within TTL is skipped and counted as duplicate

### 2. Retries with Backoff + Circuit Breaker ‚úÖ
- **Implementation**: `retry_circuit_breaker.py` with exponential backoff
- **Features**:
  - Configurable retry attempts with exponential backoff
  - Circuit breaker for consistently failing targets
  - Jitter to prevent thundering herd
  - Per-target state tracking
  - Automatic circuit recovery
- **Acceptance**: ‚úÖ Transient failures retried; repeated failures trip breaker and generate alerts

### 3. Async, Non-blocking Execution ‚úÖ
- **Implementation**: Updated `remediator.py` with async subprocess calls
- **Features**:
  - Async subprocess execution using `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec`
  - Non-blocking network operations
  - Responsive remediator loop under load
  - Proper error handling and timeout management
- **Acceptance**: ‚úÖ Remediator loop remains responsive under load and queue size does not monotonically grow

### 4. Backpressure & Bounded Queues ‚úÖ
- **Implementation**: `bounded_queue.py` with multiple strategies
- **Features**:
  - Configurable queue size limits
  - Multiple backpressure strategies (BLOCK, DROP_OLDEST, DROP_NEWEST, REJECT)
  - Timeout handling for put/get operations
  - Real-time metrics and utilization monitoring
  - Queue saturation alerts
- **Acceptance**: ‚úÖ When queue is full, producers receive controlled failure or system falls back to safe behavior

### 5. Action Parameter Policy ‚úÖ
- **Implementation**: `action_policy.py` with rule-based enforcement
- **Features**:
  - Policy rules for different action types and targets
  - IP range-based policies (private vs public)
  - User pattern matching (admin vs regular users)
  - Agent pattern matching (critical vs test agents)
  - Approval workflow for sensitive operations
  - Policy evaluation with priority-based rule matching
- **Acceptance**: ‚úÖ Actions violating policy require human approval; audit entry created

## üìä Key Features Implemented

### Idempotency System
```python
# Check if action already executed
is_executed, record = execution_tracker.is_action_executed(action_name, target, playbook_id)

# Record execution with TTL
execution_id = execution_tracker.record_action_execution(
    action_name, target, playbook_id, "executed", result, error
)
```

### Retry with Circuit Breaker
```python
# Execute with retry and circuit breaker
success, result, error = await retry_circuit_breaker.execute_with_retry(
    action_name, target, async_function, *args, **kwargs
)
```

### Bounded Queue with Backpressure
```python
# Create bounded queue
queue = BoundedQueue(QueueConfig(max_size=1000, strategy=QueueStrategy.BLOCK))

# Put with backpressure handling
success = await queue.put(item, timeout=30.0)

# Get with timeout
item = await queue.get(timeout=30.0)
```

### Action Policy Enforcement
```python
# Evaluate action against policies
evaluation = action_policy_engine.evaluate_action(
    action_name, target, playbook_id, requester, context
)

# Handle approval workflow
if evaluation.approval_required:
    approval_request_id = evaluation.approval_request_id
    # ... approval workflow
```
