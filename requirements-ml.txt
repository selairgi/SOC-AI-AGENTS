# Machine Learning Dependencies for SOC AI Agents (Development/Testing)
# Install with: pip install -r requirements-base.txt -r requirements-ml.txt

# Heavy ML Dependencies (Only for development/testing with semantic detector)
torch~=2.1.0
sentence-transformers~=2.2.2

# Note: These are only used in:
# - tests/test_semantic_detector.py
# - security/semantic_detector.py (not used in production)
#
# Production deployment uses intelligent_prompt_detector.py instead,
# which only requires numpy and scikit-learn (already in requirements-base.txt)
#
# Total additional size: ~2.3GB
