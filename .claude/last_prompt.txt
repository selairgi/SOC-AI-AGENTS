in the variation generator, use open ai api key to generate many variations, for each miss of the soc , the variations are generated and stored in the memory, but dont exceed memory , but how we detect the miss ? its with the output of the chatbot , if the flag is reveiled, 
to test this workflow, create a mini clone of the repo, with low security bounderies to the flag, which means the system prompt must be gentle with securing the flag.
then test the incremental learning of the soc in the mini clone.
do not modify the contants of detection in the mini clone, just modify the system prompt to make it gentle to reveil the flag
